# SQL-CASE_STUDY-1
INTRODUCTION

Danny, a passionate Japanese food lover, decided to embark on a risky venture in early 2021 by opening a charming little restaurant serving his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. However, after a few months of operation, Danny's Diner is struggling to stay afloat. Danny has then collected some basic data, but he doesn't know how to use it to improve his business. More so, he would like to improve his customer loyalty because more loyal customers mean free marketing, more revenue as they visit regularly, and genuine customer feedback to help him improve the restaurant's offerings. Hence, I am playing the role of a data analyst at Danny's Diner to help him make data-driven decisions and improve his business.
